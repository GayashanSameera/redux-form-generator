# Getting Started with redux form generator

in this repo there are several examples in containers directory.\
if we need to create form you need to use CreateForm component and need to select form type. \

### `Form types`

'FORM_TYPE_SIMPLE'  => for simple forms, you can pass function to create content
'FORM_TYPE_CHILDREN' => for forms with tabs, you can pass function to create content
'FORM_TYPE_CREATE_FROM_JSON' => for every forms, you can pass JSON to create content and need to pass several hooks


## Available form generator formats

### `Function generator`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `JSON generator`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
